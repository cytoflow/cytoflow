These are some questions that are commonly asked about Cytoflow's GUI,
especially by new users.

**I've made one of the panels (eg, the View settings panel) disappear. How do I make it come back?**

You can restore them by going to the ``View`` menu and toggling the checkbox next to the panel 
that you made disappear.
