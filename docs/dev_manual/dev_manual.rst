Hooray!  
First, install the source code and get a development environment going.
Then, have a look at the design documentation.  Finally


Great!  May I recommend you start with some example Jupyter notebooks.
They provide a good introduction to both basic modules and some of
Cytoflow's more advanced features.

* `Basic flow cytometry analysis <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Basic%20Cytometry.ipynb>`_
* `An small-molecule induction curve with yeast <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Yeast%20Dose%20Response.ipynb>`_
* `Machine learning methods applied to flow cytometry <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Machine%20Learning.ipynb>`_
* `Reproduced an analysis from a published paper <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/kiani/Kiani%20Nature%20Methods%202014.ipynb>`_
* `A multidimensional induction in yeast <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/yeast/Induction%20Timecourse.ipynb>`_
* `Calibrated flow cytometry in MEFLs <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/tasbe/TASBE%20Workflow.ipynb>`_

If you decide you want to have a go, see the :ref:`installation notes <install>`.
Quick hint: if you have Anaconda installed, say::

  conda config --add channels bpteague
  conda create --name cytoflow cytoflow 
  
This creates a new Anaconda environment named ``cytoflow`` and installs the 
latest package from the Anaconda Cloud.

For more details of these modules, you're likely to want to see the 
:ref:`module documents <modindex>`
