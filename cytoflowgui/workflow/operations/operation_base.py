class IWorkflowOperation(IOperation):
    """
    An interface that extends a :mod:`cytoflow` operation with functions 
    required for GUI support.
    
    In addition to implementing the interface below, another common thing to 
    do in the derived class is to override traits of the underlying class in 
    order to add metadata that controls their handling by the workflow.  
    Currently, relevant metadata include:
    
      * **apply** - This trait is used by the operations :meth:`apply` method.
       
      * **estimate** - This trait is used by the operation's :meth:`estimate` method.
        
      * **estimate_result** - This trait is set as a result of calling :meth:`estimate`.
     
      * **status** - Holds status variables like the number of events from the :mod:`ImportOp`.
    
      * **transient** - A temporary variable (not copied between processes or serialized).
