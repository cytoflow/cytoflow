class BeadCalibrationOp(HasStrictTraits):
    """
    Calibrate arbitrary channels to molecules-of-fluorophore using fluorescent
    beads (eg, the Spherotech RCP-30-5A rainbow beads.)
    
    To use, set the `beads_file` property to an FCS file containing the beads'
    events; specify which beads you ran by setting the `beads_type` property
    to match one of the values of BeadCalibrationOp.BEADS; and set the
    `units` dict to which channels you want calibrated and in which units.
    Then, call `estimate()` and check the peak-finding with 
    `default_view().plot()`.  If the peak-finding is wacky, try adjusting
    `bead_peak_quantile` and `bead_brightness_threshold`.  When the peaks are
    successfully identified, call apply() on your experimental data set. 
    
    If you can't make the peak finding work, please submit a bug report!
    
    This procedure works best when the beads file is very clean data.  It does
    not do its own gating (maybe a future addition?)  In the meantime, 
    I recommend gating the *acquisition* on the FSC/SSC channels in order
    to get rid of debris, cells, and other noise.
    
    Finally, because you can't have a negative number of fluorescent molecules
    (MEFLs, etc) (as well as for math reasons), this module filters out
    negative values.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The operation name (for UI representation.)

    units : Dict(Str, Str)
        A dictionary specifying the channels you want calibrated (keys) and
        the units you want them calibrated in (values).  The units must be
        keys of the `beads` attribute.       
        
    beads_file : File
        A file containing the FCS events from the beads.  Must be set to use
        `estimate()`.  This isn't persisted by `pickle()`.

    beads : Dict(Str, List(Float))
        The beads' characteristics.  Keys are calibrated units (ie, MEFL or
        MEAP) and values are ordered lists of known fluorophore levels.  Common
        values for this dict are included in BeadCalibrationOp.BEADS.
        Must be set to use `estimate()`.
        
    bead_peak_quantile : Int
        The quantile threshold used to choose bead peaks.  Default == 80.
        Must be set to use `estimate()`.
        
    bead_brightness_threshold : Float
        How bright must a bead peak be to be considered?  Default == 100.
        Must be set to use `estimate()`.
        
    Notes
    -----
    The peak finding is rather sophisticated.  
    
    For each channel, a 256-bin histogram is computed on the log-transformed
    bead data, and then the histogram is smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay 
    filter (with a window length of 5 and a polynomial order of 1).  
    
    Next, a wavelet-based peak-finding algorithm is used: it convolves the
    smoothed histogram with a series of wavelets and looks for relative 
    maxima at various length-scales.  The parameters of the smoothing 
    algorithm were arrived at empircally, using beads collected at a wide 
    range of PMT voltages.
    
    Finally, the peaks are filtered by height (the histogram bin has a quantile
    greater than `bead_peak_quantile`) and intensity (brighter than 
    `bead_brightness_threshold`).
    
    How to convert from a series of peaks to mean equivalent fluorochrome?
    If there's one peak, we assume that it's the brightest peak.  If there
    are two peaks, we assume they're the brighest two.  If there are n >=3
    peaks, we check all the contiguous n-subsets of the bead intensities
    and find the one whose linear regression (in log space!) has the smallest
    norm (square-root sum-of-squared-residuals.)
    
    There's a slight subtlety in the fact that we're performing the linear
    regression in log-space: if the relationship in log10-space is Y=aX + b,
    then the same relationship in linear space is x = 10**X, y = 10**y, and
    y = (10**b) * (x ** a).
    
    One more thing.  Because the beads are (log) evenly spaced across all
    the channels, we can directly compute the fluorophore equivalent in channels
    where we wouldn't usually measure that fluorophore: for example, you can
    compute MEFL (mean equivalent fluorosceine) in the PE-Texas Red channel,
    because the bead peak pattern is the same in the PE-Texas Red channel
    as it would be in the FITC channel.
