    """
    Calibrate arbitrary channels to molecules-of-fluorophore using fluorescent
    beads (eg, the Spherotech RCP-30-5A rainbow beads.)
    
    Computes a log-linear calibration function that maps arbitrary fluorescence
    units to physical units (ie molecules equivalent fluorophore, or *MEF*).
    
    To use, set :attr:`beads_file` to an FCS file containing events collected *using
    the same cytometer settings as the data you're calibrating*.  Specify which 
    beads you ran by setting :attr:`beads_type` to match one of the  values of 
    :data:`BeadCalibrationOp.BEADS`; and set :attr:`units` to which channels you 
    want calibrated and in which units.  Then, call :meth:`estimate()` and check the 
    peak-finding with :meth:`default_view().plot()`.  If the peak-finding is wacky, 
    try adjusting :attr:`bead_peak_quantile` and :attr:`bead_brightness_threshold`.  When 
    the peaks are successfully identified, call :meth:`apply` to scale your 
    experimental data set. 
    
    If you can't make the peak finding work, please submit a bug report!
    
    This procedure works best when the beads file is very clean data.  It does
    not do its own gating (maybe a future addition?)  In the meantime, 
    I recommend gating the *acquisition* on the FSC/SSC channels in order
    to get rid of debris, cells, and other noise.
    
    Finally, because you can't have a negative number of fluorescent molecules
    (MEFLs, etc) (as well as for math reasons), this module filters out
    negative values.    
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    units : Dict(Str, Str)
        A dictionary specifying the channels you want calibrated (keys) and
        the units you want them calibrated in (values).  The units must be
        keys of the :attr:`beads` attribute.       
        
    beads_file : File
        A file containing the FCS events from the beads.

    beads : Dict(Str, List(Float))
        The beads' characteristics.  Keys are calibrated units (ie, MEFL or
        MEAP) and values are ordered lists of known fluorophore levels.  Common
        values for this dict are included in :data:`BeadCalibrationOp.BEADS`.
        
    bead_peak_quantile : Int (default = 80)
        The quantile threshold used to choose bead peaks. 
        
    bead_brightness_threshold : Float (default = 100)
        How bright must a bead peak be to be considered?  
        
    bead_brightness_cutoff : Float
        If a bead peak is above this, then don't consider it.  Takes care of
        clipping saturated detection.  Defaults to 70% of the detector range.
        
    bead_histogram_bins : Int (default = 512)
        The number of bins to use in computing the bead histogram.  Tweak
        this if the peak find is having difficulty, or if you have a small 
        number of events
        
    force_linear : Bool (default = False)
        A linear fit in log space doesn't always go through the origin, which 
        means that the calibration function isn't strictly a multiplicative
        scaling operation.  Set :attr:`force_linear` to force the such
        behavior.  Keep an eye on the diagnostic plot, though, to see how much
        error you're introducing!
   
           
    Notes
    -----
    The peak finding is rather sophisticated.  
    
    For each channel, a 256-bin histogram is computed on the log-transformed
    bead data, and then the histogram is smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay 
    filter (with a window length of 5 and a polynomial order of 1).  
    
    Next, a wavelet-based peak-finding algorithm is used: it convolves the
    smoothed histogram with a series of wavelets and looks for relative 
    maxima at various length-scales.  The parameters of the smoothing 
    algorithm were arrived at empircally, using beads collected at a wide 
    range of PMT voltages.
    
    Finally, the peaks are filtered by height (the histogram bin has a quantile
    greater than `bead_peak_quantile`) and intensity (brighter than 
    :attr:`bead_brightness_threshold`).
    
    How to convert from a series of peaks to mean equivalent fluorochrome?
    If there's one peak, we assume that it's the brightest peak.  If there
    are two peaks, we assume they're the brightest two.  If there are ``n >=3``
    peaks, we check all the contiguous `n`-subsets of the bead intensities
    and find the one whose linear regression (in log space!) has the smallest
    norm (square-root sum-of-squared-residuals.)
    
    There's a slight subtlety in the fact that we're performing the linear
    regression in log-space: if the relationship in log10-space is ``Y=aX + b``,
    then the same relationship in linear space is ``x = 10**X``, ``y = 10**y``, and
    ``y = (10**b) * (x ** a)``.
