class ImportOp(HasStrictTraits):
    """
    An operation for importing data and making an :class:`.Experiment`.
    
    To use, set the :attr:`conditions` dict to a mapping between condition name 
    and NumPy ``dtype``.  Useful dtypes include ``category``, ``float``, 
    ``int``, ``bool``.
    
    Next, set :attr:`tubes` to a list of :class:`Tube` containing FCS filenames 
    and the corresponding conditions.
    
    If you would rather not analyze every single event in every FCS file,
    set :attr:`events` to the number of events from each FCS file you want to 
    load.
    
    Call :meth:`apply` to load the data.  The usual ``experiment`` parameter
    can be ``None``.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    conditions : Dict(Str, Str)
        A dictionary mapping condition names (keys) to NumPy ``dtype``s (values).
        Useful ``dtype``s include ``category``, ``float``, ``int``, and ``bool``.
        
    tubes : List(Tube)
        A list of :class:``Tube`` instances, which map FCS files to their corresponding
        experimental conditions.  Each :class:``Tube`` must have a 
        :attr:``~Tube.conditions`` dict whose keys match those of 
        :attr:`conditions`.
        
    channels : Dict(Str, Str)
        If you only need a subset of the channels available in the data set,
        specify them here.  Each ``(key, value)`` pair specifies a channel to
        include in the output experiment.  The key is the channel name in the 
        FCS file, and the value is the name of the channel in the Experiment.
        You can use this to rename channels as you import data (because flow
        channel names are frequently not terribly informative.)  New channel
        names must be valid Python identifiers: start with a letter or ``_``, and
        all characters must be letters, numbers or ``_``.  If :attr:`channels` is
        empty, load all channels in the FCS files.
        
    events : Int (default = 0)
        If ``> 0``, import only a random subset of events of size :attr:`events`. 
        Presumably the analysis will go faster but less precisely; good for
        interactive data exploration.  Then, unset :attr:`events` and re-run
        the analysis non-interactively.
        
    name_metadata : {None, "$PnN", "$PnS"} (default = None)
        Which FCS metadata is the channel name?  If ``None``, attempt to  
        autodetect.
        
    ignore_v : List(Str)
        :class:`cytoflow` is designed to operate on an :class:`.Experiment` containing
        tubes that were all collected under the same instrument settings.
        In particular, the same PMT voltages ensure that data can be
        compared across samples.
        
        *Very rarely*, you may need to set up an :class:`.Experiment` with 
        different voltage settings on different :class:`Tube`s.  This is likely 
        only to be the case when you are trying to figure out which voltages 
        should be used in future experiments.  If so, set :attr:`ignore_v` to a 
        :class:`List` of channel names to ignore particular channels.

            - **range** - int
                The maximum range of this channel.  Determined by the ``$PnR``
                field from the first FCS file.
