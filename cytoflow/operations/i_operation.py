    Attributes
    ----------
    id : Str
        a unique identifier for this class. prefix: ``edu.mit.synbio.cytoflow.operations``
        
    friendly_id : Str
        The operation's human-readable id (like ``Threshold`` or ``K-means``).  
        Used for UI implementations.
        
    name : Str
        The name of this IOperation instance (like ``Debris_Filter``).  Useful

        Estimate this operation's parameters from some data.
        
        For operations that are data-driven (for example, a mixture model), 
        estimate the operation's parameters from an experiment.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        experiment : Experiment
            the :class:`.Experiment` to use in the estimation.
        
        subset : Str (optional)
            a string passed to :meth:`pandas.DataFrame.query` to select the subset
            of data on which to run the parameter estimation.
            
        Raises
        ------
        CytoflowOpException

            parameters.

        experiment : Experiment

        Returns

        Experiment
            the old :class:`Experiment` with this operation applied

        Many operations have a "default" view.  This can either be a diagnostic
        for the operation's :meth:`estimate` method, an interactive for setting
        gates, etc.  Frequently it makes sense to link the properties of the
        view to the properties of the :class:`IOperation`; sometimes, 
        :meth:`default_view` is the only way to get the view (ie, it's not 
        useful when it doesn't reference an :class:`IOperation` instance.)
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        **kwargs : Dict
            The keyword args passed to the view's constructor
