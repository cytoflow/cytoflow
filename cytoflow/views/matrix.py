class MatrixView(BaseStatisticsView):
    """
    A view that creates a matrix view (a 2D grid representation) of a statistic. 
    Set `statistic` to the name of the statistic to plot; set `feature` to the name
    of that statistic's feature you'd like to analyze.
    
    Setting `xfacet` and `yfacet` to levels of the statistic's index will result in
    a separate column or row for each value of that statistic.
    
    There are three different ways of plotting the values of the matrix view 
    (the "cells" in the matrix), controlled by the `type` parameter:
    
    * Setting `style` to ``heat`` (the default) will produce a "traditional" heat map, 
      where each "cell" is a circle and the color of the circle is related to the 
      intensity of the value of `feature`. (In this scenario, `variable` must be left empty.).
      
    * Setting `style` to ``pie`` will draw a pie plot in each cell. The values of `variable`
      are used as the categories of the pie, and the arc length of each slice of pie is related 
      to the intensity of the value of `feature`.
      
    * Set `style` to ``petal`` will draw a "petal plot" in each cell. The values of `variable` 
      are used as the categories, but unlike a pie plot, the arc width of each slice
      is equal. Instead, the radius of the pie slice scales with the square root of
      the intensity, so that the relationship between area and intensity remains the same.
          
    Optionally, you can set `size_feature` to scale the circles' (or pies or petals)' area
    by another feature. (This is often used to scale by the count of a particular population
    or subset.) In ``heat`` mode this is all you have to do, but in ``style`` or
    ``petal`` mode you must also set `size_statistic`, which must be a *different* statistic
    with all the levels of `statistic` **except** `variable`. That is, it must have a value for
    every pie or petal plot, but *not* values for all of the pie slices.

    
    Attributes

    variable : Str

    feature : Str
        The column in the statistic to plot (often a channel name.)
